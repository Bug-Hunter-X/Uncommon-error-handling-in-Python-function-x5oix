This repository contains a Python function that demonstrates an uncommon error handling issue. The function calculate_average calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, it does not handle the edge cases of an empty list or a list containing non-numeric values. The bug.py file contains the buggy code, while the bugSolution.py file demonstrates how to solve this issue by performing proper error handling.
